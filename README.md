- focus on framework agnostic libs
- framework: [astro](https://astro.build/) (try mixing react and solidjs in component islands just to see how that works)
  - on react side, make use of [preact signals](https://github.com/preactjs/signals/blob/main/packages/react/README.md#react-integration) [doc](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/)
  - maybe make use of [deep signal](https://github.com/luisherranz/deepsignal#arraylength) as well. because it lets you mutate and update the state array without copy
  - static cloudflare pages site 
  - SPA like page navigation with [turbo](https://www.maxiferreira.com/blog/astro-turbo-persistent-islands/) (will be possible [natively](https://github.com/withastro/roadmap/issues/532) in the future)
- ui lib: [panda](https://panda-css.com/)
- image list: [egjs-infinitegrid](https://naver.github.io/egjs-infinitegrid/)
- gallery items: [swiperjs](https://swiperjs.com/)
- detail page image fullscreen: [medium-zoom](https://github.com/francoischalifour/medium-zoom#framework-integrations)
- anims: [motion one](https://motion.dev/)
